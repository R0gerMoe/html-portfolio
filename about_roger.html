    <br /> <br /> For the other side, I did not happy with my family. Ther were many complicated in family.
    I were beaten every day. I were scolded every time. Unfrotunatelly, When I was Grade-8 I left the school and I went away from my family. I am sick of staying at home.
    Beacuse There is not happiness anymore. 
    <br/><br />After a year, I came to Thialand, Thoo Mweh Khee School By my father. I was not happy to leave my sisters my mom but it better to be at home.
